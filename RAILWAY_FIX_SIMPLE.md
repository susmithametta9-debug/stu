# 🚀 Fix Railway in 3 Steps (5 Minutes)

## ⚠️ The Problem
Your file has `railway.json` (old, broken) → Need `railway.toml` (new, works!)

---

## ✅ Step 1: Download the 3 Fix Files

I'll give you 3 small files to download:
1. **railway.toml** (the main fix!)
2. **nixpacks.toml** (build configuration)
3. **.railwayignore** (optimization)

---

## ✅ Step 2: Upload to GitHub

### On GitHub.com:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/studenthub

2. **Delete old file**:
   - Find `railway.json`
   - Click it → Click trash icon 🗑️
   - Commit deletion

3. **Upload new files**:
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag the 3 files I gave you
   - Commit changes

**That's it for GitHub!**

## ✅ Step 3: Railway Will Auto-Deploy

### What Happens:
1. Railway detects your GitHub update (30 seconds)
2. Starts building automatically (2-3 minutes)
3. Succeeds and gives you a URL! ✅

### OR Manually Trigger:
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your "studenthub" project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "Redeploy" button

---

## 🎉 Done!

### Your URL will be:
`https://studenthub-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

### Find it:
